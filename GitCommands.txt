How to branch

how to create github

how to push code to remote

how to pull

Part 3: Git to Gihub and vice versa:
git remote - Gives all remote location details. Example: origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/drsladit/Github-LearningRepository.git
git pull URL - first time
git push - often
git push -u origin master
It asks for github credentials, if it doesn't login. Read error description.
Sometimes if central repository(Github in this case) is no where related or if push command used first time. then it throws error.

Then first use pull command to pull from central to local.
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories and then push.

git clone URL to pull enter code
